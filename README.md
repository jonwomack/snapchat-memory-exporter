# snapchat-memory-exporter
A script that exports Snapchat memories. Snapchat's memories export is lossy since the filters/captions and time associated with each memory are separate from the raw media (mp4/jpg). This script combines the raw media with its corresponding overlay, and preserves the memory's time (for time-sorted viewing on Finder / Google Photos / etc.).
